There are two ways to make arrays in Java

1. PRE - DETERMINED VALUES ARRAY

int [] myArray = {8,4,6,2,9,6,7,1,3};

Declare the data type
[]
Name the array
Enter the values between the {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

2. ENTER VALUES AFTER ARRAY DECLARATION

int [] myArray = new int[3];

Declare the data type
[]
Name the array
Create an array object using = new int[]
between the last [] is where you enter how many points of data will go into the array
