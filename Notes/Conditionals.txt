Conditionals

Conditionals in Java work in the form of if, else if, and else statements.

Conditionals only take boolean values, meaning it is checking if a value is true or false and making a decision based
on that.

Example:
    int value = 1;
        if (value == 2 ){
            System.out.println("I am 2");
        } else if (value == 3) {
            System.out.println("I am 3");
        } else {
            System.out.println("I am 1");
        }
