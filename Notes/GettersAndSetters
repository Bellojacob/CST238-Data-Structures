Getter and Setter methods go in the object class
These methods are used to set and retrieve attributes
These methods are the correct way to set attributes values rather than ex: car.speed(100);

Instead of saying that, you would say car.setSpeed(100);
So, instead of setting value straight to speed, you would call the method for setSpeed and pass in the speed value (100);

Essentially,
let's say we have a class name car
    Public class Car {

then we have our attributes of car
    int speed;
    String model;
    String color;

Then we can create a constructor for car (set default values for car)
    car(int speed, String model, String color){
        this.speed = speed;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color
}
