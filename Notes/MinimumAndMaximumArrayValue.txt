This is the method to find the maximum value in an array.

1. Let's assume this is our array and it's values:
int [] myArray = {1,4,6,2,9,6,7,1,3};

2. Next let's create a maximum value integer variable
int maximumValue = myArray[0];

3. Now let's loop through the array, and it will check if each index is greater than the maximum (one at a time),
   and if it is greater, then the maximum value variable will be set to whatever that index value is
 for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){
            if (myArray[i] > maximumValue) {
                maximumValue = myArray[0];
            }
        }

4. We can check our code by checking what the value of maximumValue is after the loop is ran
System.out.println(maximumValue);



This is the method to find the Minimum value in an array

1. This is our array and our array values:
int [] myArray = {1,4,6,2,9,6,7,1,3};

 2. Now let's create a minimum value variable and set it equal to the first value of the array
 int minimumValue = myArray[0];

 3. Now let's loop through the array and if the current array index is less than the minimumValue variable
    value then set the minimumValue to the current index
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){
            if (myArray[i] < minimumValue){
                minimumValue = myArray[i];
            }
        }

4. We can check our work by printing out the value
System.out.println(minimumValue);
