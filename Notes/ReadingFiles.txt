Let's Read data from files!

A very simple way to read from a text file is to use a filereader and scanner

import java.io.*
add throws clause to main

FileReader filereader = new FileReader("myFilePath.txt");
Scanner filescanner = new Scanner(filereader);

to read the entire content (for Strings) of a file, we can say:
while(filescanner.hasNextLine()) {              // while the Scanner has a next line
    String line = filescanner.nextLine();       // save the String as line
    System.out.println(line);                   // print line and loop through again
    }

make sure to close FileReader, but not Scanner
filescanner.close();

.hasNextLine()      // looks for next line
.next()             // grabs the next String that is seperated by white space
.nextLine()         // reads lines at a time
.nextInt()          // reads next int
